Toadfarm::Manual::Intro - Introduction to Toadfarm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual aims to give an introduction to how to set up C<toadfarm>.

=head2 Script

First you need to create a basic script to describe when an application
will be triggered. This is a plain Perl script which allow you to pull in
any trick you like form the Perl toolbox.

Example:

  #!/usr/bin/perl
  use Toadfarm -dsl;

  mount "/home/web/project1/script/app1" => {
    "X-Request-Base" => "http://mydomain.com/whatever"
  };

  mount "Web::App2" => {
    "Host" => "mydomain.com",
  };

  start;

The script above will pass the request on to C<app1> when the
"X-Request-Base" header is set to "http://mydomain.com/whatever".
Or it will pass the request on to C<Web::App2> if the "Host" header
is set to "mydomain.com".

You can save the content of the file anywhere and run it as any other
L<Mojolicious> application.

Note: There are other special fields to trigger on, besides HTTP headers. See
L<Toadfarm::Manual::Config/Apps> for more details.

=head2 Start Toadfarm

After you have saved the config file, you can start the L<Toadfarm> application:

  $ /path/to/your-script start

After this, you should see C<your-script> running and the applications can be
accessed from L<http://localhost:8080>.

=head2 Further reading

See L<Toadfarm::Manual::RunningToadfarm> for more command line options, and
L<Toadfarm::Manual::Config> for full list of config file options.

=head2 Listen to standard ports

Setting up an iptables rules will allow Toadfarm to listen to port 8080, while
still receiving traffic on the default port. This is a good idea security wise,
since it will not require Toadfarm to be started as "root".

  $ iptables -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8080
  $ iptables -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8443

Note: You need to replace "eth0" with the appropriate interface.
