Toadfarm::Manual::RunningToadfarm - Command line options

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual goes through different options on how to start your
L<Toadfarm> application.

=head2 Basics

You can see the different options by simply running your application with
no options:

  $ /path/to/your-script
  $ /path/to/your-script help

=head2 Actions

In addition to all the default L<commands|Mojolicious::Commands/COMMANDS>,
L<Toadfarm> adds some more:

=over 4

=item * L<Toadfarm::Command::start>

  $ /path/to/your-script start

Will only start your application if not running.

=item * L<Toadfarm::Command::stop>

  $ /path/to/your-script stop

Will stop your application. Note that this command waits for the
application to stop, which could take
L<several seconds|Mojo::Server::Hypnotoad/graceful_timeout>.

=item * L<Toadfarm::Command::reload>

  $ /path/to/your-script reload

Will either start the application or
L<hot deploy|Mojo::Server::Hypnotoad/USR2> it. This means loading
in new version of your application, without loosing any connections.

=head2 Init

Your script can be used as an init-script. Example script:

  #!/path/to/your/perl
  ### BEGIN INIT INFO
  # Provides:          toadfarm
  # Required-Start:    $local_fs $network mysql postgresql
  # Required-Stop:     $local_fs $network mysql postgresql
  # Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
  # Default-Stop:      0 1 6
  # Short-Description: Toadfarm web application
  ### END INIT INFO

  use Toadfarm -dsl;
  # ...
  start;

You can put the code above in C</etc/init.d/your-script>:

  # Create a toadfarm script in init.d
  $ sudo $EDITOR /etc/init.d/your-script

  # Make it executable
  $ sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/your-script

  # Make it start on boot
  $ sudo update-rc.d your-script defaults;

=head2 Crontab

If you want to use crontab to start your script, you can do it with this line:

  * * * * * /path/to/your-script start 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null

The trick here is to use "start" which will only start your server and not
hot deploy it if it's already running.

=head2 Other ways

It is possible to start the server using the standard L<Mojolicious> tools
as well:

  $ /path/to/your-script daemon --listen http://*:5000
  $ morbo /path/to/your-script
  $ hypnotoad /path/to/your-script
